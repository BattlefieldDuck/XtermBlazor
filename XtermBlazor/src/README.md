# XtermBlazor

XtermBlazor is a robust Blazor library that seamlessly integrates the xterm.js terminal emulator into Blazor applications, providing a rich and interactive command-line interface experience.

## Usage

If you make any changes to the `index.ts` file, you'll need to compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript.

### Install Dependencies

Install all necessary dependencies listed in the `package.json` file by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile TypeScript Files

Run the following command to compile TypeScript files to JavaScript. This will create `wwwroot/XtermBlazor.min.js` and `wwwroot/XtermBlazor.min.css`:

```sh
npm run build
```
